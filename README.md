This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

The project is a sample application that can be used to sell mugs, plates and other stuff.

It has fake back-end (request .env file for API URLs references)

The profile infos are hardcoded, you cannot edit it via "Edit profile" form

To test the app as a user click "Register" and enter ANY valid registration info.

Images for the products were choosen randomly.

Sample back-end server - https://my-json-server.typicode.com/evgeniy-kokhno-itechart/mug-store-data
NOTE! Changes are faked and aren't persisted in sample server.
