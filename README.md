This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

The project is a sample application that can be used to sell mugs, plates and other stuff.

It has no back-end - so the stubs are used in *Service files.

To access and test as admin use credentials
login: superadmin
pass: 12345
The pass is hardcoded, you cannot edit it via "Edit profile" form

To test the app as a user click "Register" and enter ANY valid registration info.

Image for the products was choosen randomly.

Sample back-end server - https://my-json-server.typicode.com/evgeniy-kokhno-itechart/mug-store-data
NOTE! Changes are faked and aren't persisted in sample server.
